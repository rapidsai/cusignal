def resample(x, num, t=None, axis=0, window=None, domain="time"):
    """
    Resample `x` to `num` samples using Fourier method along the given axis.

    The resampled signal starts at the same value as `x` but is sampled
    with a spacing of ``len(x) / num * (spacing of x)``.  Because a
    Fourier method is used, the signal is assumed to be periodic.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        The data to be resampled.
    num : int
        The number of samples in the resampled signal.
    t : array_like, optional
        If `t` is given, it is assumed to be the sample positions
        associated with the signal data in `x`.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis of `x` that is resampled.  Default is 0.
    window : array_like, callable, string, float, or tuple, optional
        Specifies the window applied to the signal in the Fourier
        domain.  See below for details.
    domain : string, optional
        A string indicating the domain of the input `x`:

        ``time``
           Consider the input `x` as time-domain. (Default)
        ``freq``
           Consider the input `x` as frequency-domain.

    Returns
    -------
    resampled_x or (resampled_x, resampled_t)
        Either the resampled array, or, if `t` was given, a tuple
        containing the resampled array and the corresponding resampled
        positions.

    See Also
    --------
    decimate : Downsample the signal after applying an FIR or IIR filter.
    resample_poly : Resample using polyphase filtering and an FIR filter.

    Notes
    -----
    The argument `window` controls a Fourier-domain window that tapers
    the Fourier spectrum before zero-padding to alleviate ringing in
    the resampled values for sampled signals you didn't intend to be
    interpreted as band-limited.

    If `window` is a function, then it is called with a vector of inputs
    indicating the frequency bins (i.e. fftfreq(x.shape[axis]) ).

    If `window` is an array of the same length as `x.shape[axis]` it is
    assumed to be the window to be applied directly in the Fourier
    domain (with dc and low-frequency first).

    For any other type of `window`, the function `cusignal.get_window`
    is called to generate the window.

    The first sample of the returned vector is the same as the first
    sample of the input vector.  The spacing between samples is changed
    from ``dx`` to ``dx * len(x) / num``.

    If `t` is not None, then it represents the old sample positions,
    and the new sample positions will be returned as well as the new
    samples.

    As noted, `resample` uses FFT transformations, which can be very
    slow if the number of input or output samples is large and prime;
    see `scipy.fftpack.fft`.

def resample_poly(x, up, down, axis=0, window=("kaiser", 5.0), gpupath=True):
    """
    Resample `x` along the given axis using polyphase filtering.

    The signal `x` is upsampled by the factor `up`, a zero-phase low-pass
    FIR filter is applied, and then it is downsampled by the factor `down`.
    The resulting sample rate is ``up / down`` times the original sample
    rate. Values beyond the boundary of the signal are assumed to be zero
    during the filtering step.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        The data to be resampled.
    up : int
        The upsampling factor.
    down : int
        The downsampling factor.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis of `x` that is resampled. Default is 0.
    window : string, tuple, or array_like, optional
        Desired window to use to design the low-pass filter, or the FIR filter
        coefficients to employ. See below for details.
    gpupath : bool, Optional
        Optional path for filter design. gpupath == False may be desirable if
        filter sizes are small.

    Returns
    -------
    resampled_x : array
        The resampled array.

    See Also
    --------
    decimate : Downsample the signal after applying an FIR or IIR filter.
    resample : Resample up or down using the FFT method.

    Notes
    -----
    This polyphase method will likely be faster than the Fourier method
    in `cusignal.resample` when the number of samples is large and
    prime, or when the number of samples is large and `up` and `down`
    share a large greatest common denominator. The length of the FIR
    filter used will depend on ``max(up, down) // gcd(up, down)``, and
    the number of operations during polyphase filtering will depend on
    the filter length and `down` (see `cusignal.upfirdn` for details).

    The argument `window` specifies the FIR low-pass filter design.

    If `window` is an array_like it is assumed to be the FIR filter
    coefficients. Note that the FIR filter is applied after the upsampling
    step, so it should be designed to operate on a signal at a sampling
    frequency higher than the original by a factor of `up//gcd(up, down)`.
    This function's output will be centered with respect to this array, so it
    is best to pass a symmetric filter with an odd number of samples if, as
    is usually the case, a zero-phase filter is desired.

    For any other type of `window`, the functions `cusignal.get_window`
    and `cusignal.firwin` are called to generate the appropriate filter
    coefficients.

    The first sample of the returned vector is the same as the first
    sample of the input vector. The spacing between samples is changed
    from ``dx`` to ``dx * down / float(up)``.

    Examples
    --------
    Note that the end of the resampled data rises to meet the first
    sample of the next cycle for the FFT method, and gets closer to zero
    for the polyphase method:

    Notes

    The algorithm is an implementation of the block diagram shown on page 129
