# Some notes on function parameters:
#
# `cutoff` and `width` are given as numbers between 0 and 1.  These are

# For example, if the Nyquist frequency is 2 KHz, then width=0.15 is a width
# of 300 Hz.

# This is a potential source of confusion, so in the following code,
# we will always use the number of taps as the parameterization of
# the 'size' of the filter. The "number of taps" means the number
# of coefficients, which is the same as the length of the impulse
# response of the filter.

    FIR filter design using the window method.

    This function computes the coefficients of a finite impulse response
    filter.  The filter will have linear phase; it will be Type I if
    `numtaps` is odd and Type II if `numtaps` is even.

    Type II filters always have zero response at the Nyquist frequency, so a
    ValueError exception is raised if firwin is called with `numtaps` even and
    having a passband whose right end is at the Nyquist frequency.

    Parameters
    ----------
    numtaps : int
        Length of the filter (number of coefficients, i.e. the filter
        order + 1).  `numtaps` must be odd if a passband includes the
        Nyquist frequency.
    cutoff : float or 1D array_like
        Cutoff frequency of filter (expressed in the same units as `fs`)
        OR an array of cutoff frequencies (that is, band edges). In the
        latter case, the frequencies in `cutoff` should be positive and
        monotonically increasing between 0 and `fs/2`.  The values 0 and
        `fs/2` must not be included in `cutoff`.
    width : float or None, optional
        If `width` is not None, then assume it is the approximate width
        of the transition region (expressed in the same units as `fs`)
        for use in Kaiser FIR filter design.  In this case, the `window`
        argument is ignored.
    window : string or tuple of string and parameter values, optional
        Desired window to use. See `cusignal.get_window` for a list
        of windows and required parameters.
    pass_zero : {True, False, 'bandpass', 'lowpass', 'highpass', 'bandstop'},
        optional
        If True, the gain at the frequency 0 (i.e. the "DC gain") is 1.
        If False, the DC gain is 0. Can also be a string argument for the
        desired filter type (equivalent to ``btype`` in IIR design functions).

        .. versionadded:: 1.3.0
           Support for string arguments.
    scale : bool, optional
        Set to True to scale the coefficients so that the frequency
        response is exactly unity at a certain frequency.
        That frequency is either:

        - 0 (DC) if the first passband starts at 0 (i.e. pass_zero
          is True)
        - `fs/2` (the Nyquist frequency) if the first passband ends at
          `fs/2` (i.e the filter is a single band highpass filter);
          center of first passband otherwise

    nyq : float, optional
        *Deprecated.  Use `fs` instead.*  This is the Nyquist frequency.
        Each frequency in `cutoff` must be between 0 and `nyq`. Default
        is 1.
    fs : float, optional
        The sampling frequency of the signal.  Each frequency in `cutoff`
        must be between 0 and ``fs/2``.  Default is 2.
    gpupath : bool, Optional
        Optional path for filter design. gpupath == False may be desirable if
        filter sizes are small.

    Returns
    -------
    h : (numtaps,) ndarray
        Coefficients of length `numtaps` FIR filter.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If any value in `cutoff` is less than or equal to 0 or greater
        than or equal to ``fs/2``, if the values in `cutoff` are not strictly
        monotonically increasing, or if `numtaps` is even but a passband
        includes the Nyquist frequency.
