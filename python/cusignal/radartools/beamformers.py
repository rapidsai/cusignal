def mvdr(x, sv, calc_cov=True):
    """
    Minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer weights

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray
        Received signal or input covariance matrix, assume 2D array with
        size [num_sensors, num_samples]

    sv: ndarray
        Steering vector, assume 1D array with size [num_sensors, 1]

    calc_cov : bool
        Determine whether to calculate covariance matrix. Simply put, calc_cov
        defines whether x input is made of sensor/observation data or is
        a precalculated covariance matrix

    Note: Unlike MATLAB where input matrix x is of size MxN where N represents
    the number of array elements, we assume row-major formatted data where each
    row is assumed to be complex-valued data from a given sensor (i.e. NxM)
    """
    if x.shape[0] > x.shape[1]:
        raise ValueError('Matrix has more sensors than samples. Consider \
            transposing and remember cuSignal is row-major, unlike MATLAB')

    if x.shape[0] != sv.shape[0]:
        raise ValueError('Steering Vector and input data do not align')

    if calc_cov:
        R = cp.cov(x)
    else:
        R = cp.asarray(x)

    R_inv = cp.linalg.inv(R)
    svh = cp.transpose(cp.conj(sv))

    wB = cp.matmul(R_inv, sv)
    # wA is a 1x1 scalar
    wA = cp.matmul(svh, wB)
    w = wB / wA

    return w
